<h1>Top 10 Tallest Buildings In The World</h1>

<p>This list of tallest buildings includes skyscrapers with continuously occupiable floors and a height of at least 350 m.
	Non-building structures, such as towers, are not included in this list (see list of tallest buildings and structures).</p>

<p>As of 2019, this list includes all 64 buildings (completed and architecturally topped out) which reach a height of
	350 metres (1,150 ft) or more, as assessed by their highest architectural feature. Of these, 27 (48%) are in China.
	Six of the last seven buildings to have held the record as 'tallest building' are still found in the list, with the
	exception being the North Tower of the original World Trade Center at 417 metres (1,368 ft) after its destruction in
	the September 11 attacks of 2001. If the twin towers were still standing today they would occupy numbers 24 and 25
	on the list (or 23 and 24 since it can be assumed the rebuilt One World Trade Center would have never been built).</p>
