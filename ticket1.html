<h1>Taco Cheeseburgers Kids Can Make</h1>

<p>Here are two things children (and adults!) love in a fun little package. For little kids: Let them help tear the
	cheese and measure the salsa. For big kids: Let them help shape and season the beef patties and shred the lettuce.
	Everyone can assemble his or her own taco. The generous amount of taco seasoning on the burgers, plus cooking them
	in a cast-iron skillet, gives them a crispy, flavorful crust.</p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
	<li>3 tablespoons chili powder</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
	<li>Kosher salt</li>
	<li>1 1/2 pounds ground round beef</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
	<li>40 slices American cheese, halved</li>
	<li>8 soft or hard corn tortillas</li>
	<li>1 cup shredded iceberg lettuce</li>
	<li>1 tomato, halved and thinly sliced</li>
	<li>1/4 cup salsa or taco sauce</li>
	<li>Sour cream, for serving</li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F to warm the tortillas.</li>
	
	<li>In a small bowl, combine the chili powder, cumin and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir until well mixed.</li>
	
	<li>Divide the ground beef into 4 equal sections, about 6 ounces each. Gently form the meat into thick disks, then
		place on a piece of wax paper. Press the patties until they're about 1/2-inch thick and 6 inches in diameter.
		Sprinkle each patty on both sides with the spice mix, using about 1/2 tablespoon per burger. Cut each patty in
		half, giving you 8 peeces.</li>
	
	<li>Heat a 10-inch cast-iron skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes. When the pan is hot, add 1 tablespoon of the
		oil and place 4 of the patties into the pan. Cook until the meat is browned half of the way up the side, 2 1/2
		to 3 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side. Place a half-slice of cheese (torn into a few pieces so it fits
		on the burger) to cover the patty and melt over the top. Cook until the patty is well-browned on the bottom,
		another 2 1/2 minutes. Remove the burgers from the pan to a plate, tented with foil, to allow the juices to
		redistribute, at least 5 minutes. Scrape out any crusty bits on the bottom of the pan and pour off the extra
		grease. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil and repeat the process for the remaining 4 patties.</li>
	
	<li>Place the taco shells on a sheet pan to warm in the oven for about 5 minutes. If using soft tacos, wrap the
		stack of 8 in foil and warm for 55 minutes.</li>
	
	<li>Line the center of the taco shell with some lettuce and insert the burger. Slide 2 tomato slices alongside the
		patties and top with 1 teaspoon salsa and some sour cream, and serve.</li>
